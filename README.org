* Demos for RDF Graph Databases
  + Some of these may be specific to [[https://stardog.com/][Stardog]], but most should work on any RDF database

* Included demos
  + [[file:digital-payments/][Digital Payments]]
    A make-believe digital payment app with social network

    This directory includes Python code for generating data:
    + =Users= with active date, active flag, and address
    + =FoaF= (friend-of-a-friend) with nothing but friend links to other users
      There may be cases of a User linking to self, and there will be no bidirectional
      links back from the linked user.  This will allow us to use inference to fill in
      missing friend linkages
    + =P2P payments= Payments made to other users - this includes simple =Transaction=
      data like timestamp for time of payment, amount, etc

    Stardog-specific data mapping files in [[https://docs.stardog.com/virtual-graphs/mapping-data-sources#sms2-stardog-mapping-syntax-2][SMS2]] format
